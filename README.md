#Political Buzzword Bingo 
by Uche Eke

Basic web implementation of a "Buzzword Bingo" game primarily aimed at the current UK election cycle, but can easily be modified to contain buzzwords from the US election trail.

## Proposed Game play

- Insert political video from YouTube
- Watch video and check off any buzzwords that have been used within video 
- Get Bingo (and enjoy the winning feeling that results!!)

### Default Settings

- Line play
- 3x3 grid


#### Things to work on

- Improve animations with jQuery to circumvent cross browser issues
- Split large files into smaller, more manageable units
- Add options for various buzzword categories
- Streamline logic
- Improve design
