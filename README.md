#Political Buzzword Bingo 
by Uche Eke

Basic web implementation of a "Buzzword Bingo" game primarily aimed at the current UK election cycle, but can easily be modified to contain buzzwords from the US election trail. It's also my first JavaScript project, so it's got rough edges....lots of 'em!

## Proposed Game play

- Insert political video from YouTube. (Short, slogan-and-soundbyte-filled election trail videos are recommended)
- Watch video and check off any buzzwords that have been used within video 
- Get Bingo (and enjoy the winning feeling that results!!)

### Default Settings

- Line play
- 3x3 grid


#### Things to work on

- Improve animations with jQuery to circumvent cross browser issues
- Split large files into smaller, more manageable units
- Add options for various buzzword categories
- Streamline logic
- Improve design
